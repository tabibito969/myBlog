            <p>Hello everyone, you can call me Tabibito. This is my ideal: to become a digital nomad and travel around the world.</p>
            <p>Even though the entire website is written in English, I actually took Japanese for the Gaokao (China's college entrance exam) and my English isn't good. I just used an English font—that's the only reason! </p>

In his twenties, his thinking already reached the boundaries of existential inquiry. The following year, he incorporated physical sensations into his writing, turning his focus to the sunlight, rocks, wind, and salt along the Algerian Mediterranean coast, and immersing himself in the perceptions of the land and the human body. This gave birth to Noces (Weddings), which became</p></div>
